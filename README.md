# MagDiffSim
Quick magnetic neutron diffraction simmulator for a triangular lattice of Yb3+ ions

This notebook was made in part as an exercise and in part to try to set up a means of quickly calculating diffraction patterns for different possible magnetic structures on the fly.  Should anyone stumble across this who wants to this for non-pedagogical reasons, look into SpinW.
